"""
Here we put subpackages. For example, without running this code
you would have to run `from speech2phone import pca`. 
After running this code, we can call 
`import speech2phone; speech2phone.pca.foo()`.
This difference is why you can call 
`import numpy as np; np.linalg.solve()` just fine, but
`import scipy as sp; sp.linalg.solve()` doesn't work.
You have to call `import from scipy import linalg`.
